    "by multiplication) at the level of a first-year mathematics graduate student.\n",

    "- Motivate heterodyning as a way to move information in the frequency domain.\n",

    "## 1. Motivation\n",
    "\n",
    "In many applications (radio communications, imaging, signal processing) we have a\n",
    "time-dependent signal $x(t)$ whose **frequency content** (Fourier transform) is\n",
    "concentrated near some frequency band.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we want to **move** that content from one frequency band to another:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a radio receiver, a high-frequency radio signal is multiplied by a locally\n",
    "  generated oscillation so that its content is shifted down to a low (\"intermediate\")\n",
    "  frequency where it is easier to filter and digitize.\n",
    "- In imaging (e.g. Fourier optics, MRI), we often modulate signals with oscillations\n",
    "  to encode spatial or temporal frequencies in a convenient band.\n",
    "\n",
    "This operation of *shifting the spectrum* of a signal by multiplying with an\n",
    "oscillation is called **heterodyning** or **mixing**.\n"

    "## 2. The mathematical idea\n",

    "Let $ x : \\mathbb{R} \\to \\mathbb{C} $ be a \"nice\" signal with Fourier transform\n",

    "X(f) = \\int_{\\mathbb{R}} x(t)\\, e^{-2\\pi i f t}\\, dt.\n",

    "$$\n",
    "y(t) = x(t)\\, e^{2\\pi i f_0 t}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then (by a one-line computation) the Fourier transform of $y$ is\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y(f) = X(f - f_0).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So *multiplication in time* by $e^{2\\pi i f_0 t}$ corresponds to a **shift in\n",
    "frequency** by $+f_0$.  \n",

    "This is exactly the mechanism of heterodyning:\n",

    "- If $X(f)$ is concentrated near frequencies around $f_c$,\n",

    "In practice, we often use real-valued cosines instead of complex exponentials.\n",
    "Using $ \\cos(2\\pi f_0 t) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(e^{2\\pi i f_0 t} + e^{-2\\pi i f_0 t}) $,\n",
